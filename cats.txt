Trap-Neuter-Return, the humane approach to addressing community cat populations, works. 
It saves catsâ€™ lives and is effective. TNR improves the lives of cats, addresses community concerns, reduces complaints about cats, and stops the breeding cycle. TNR improves the co-existence between 
outdoor cats and humans in our shared environment. 
This is why so many cities are adopting it.
